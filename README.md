=============
Simple example of integrating Drools Expert with Drools Fusion

DISCLAIMER
I do not own any jar located in /lib directory. All of them are takem from Drools official repository. I uploaded only for academic (AGH Krakow) purposes. One day i'll convert project to maven project and remove libs.
